## Installation

For starters, I used HTML to insert necessary contents for the web page. This includes title, subtitle, header, footer, and main contents of the webpage which is about HTML, CSS, Git, and Java script. Then, I used CSS to put them into structure. I made boarders and boundaries around the header and footer as well as arounnd each of the main contents. Next, I used JavaScript to create interactive interface that works on Chrome DevTools. I coded the program to have random subjects (HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript) to pop up in consol under "what should we study today?". 

## Usage
Use command+option+i on mac and control+shift+i on windows to open DevTools on Chrome to see text under consol.
